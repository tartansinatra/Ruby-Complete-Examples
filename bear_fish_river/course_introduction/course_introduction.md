### Introduction

Introduce ourselves.

All on your way to become programmers.  This course is to acclerate you to that goal.  Rather than you banging your head off random walls.  We'll direct you to right walls to bang your head off :)

Ice breaker.  Why did you want to learn to program? Everyone including instructors.  Pair up, the person next to you will deliver your reasons.

There Will Be Two Kinds of People in the World…
…those who tell computers what to do, and those who’re told by computers what to do.

What does it mean to be able to program? What does it mean to communicate in any language. You are expressing your thoughts via the language. Learning to program is learning to take your thoughts and communicate it to a computer.

This course is about getting you to know how to communicate with computers.  We'll take you through how current languages work and the how we communicate with them.  In particular Ruby, Javascript.

Reusing existing code. Write the code to handle the problem you are working on.  Libraries that we can re-use.  Sinatra, Rails, Cordova.
